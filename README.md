# MERN Project README ðŸš€

Welcome to our MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) project repository! This project is a full-stack web application built using modern technologies and tools. Below, you'll find all the necessary information to get started with the project.

## Overview

Our project is a web application developed using the MERN stack. It consists of a frontend built with Vite, Material-UI, React Router, and Recharts, utilizing TypeScript for type safety and Redux with RTK Query for state management. The backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js, with data stored and managed using MongoDB through Mongoose. Additionally, we've incorporated regression-js for regression analysis functionality.

## Features

- **Frontend:**
  - Developed with Vite for fast and efficient bundling.
  - Utilizes Material-UI for sleek and responsive UI components.
  - Implements Recharts for interactive and customizable charts and graphs.
  - TypeScript ensures type safety and improved developer experience.
  - State management handled with Redux and RTK Query for seamless data fetching and caching.
  - Integrated React Router for declarative routing.
  - Icons provided by Heroicons for beautiful and consistent iconography.

- **Backend:**
  - Powered by Node.js and Express.js for scalable server-side logic.
  - MongoDB database used for data storage and retrieval.
  - Mongoose ORM for simplified interaction with MongoDB.
  - Regression-js library incorporated for regression analysis functionality.
